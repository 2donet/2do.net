# 2do.net
Doing: **Volunteering platform**
To do: **Platform cooperative**

### Overview
Platform for projects: join communities created around initiatives that need support. Discuss ideas, publicly cooperate on tasks, supply projects, and get rewards for your involvement from open pool prizes. The goal is to create a system by improving this website, developing software for collaboration, preparing rules of democratic project management, and founding organization to incubate ideas.

### Introduction
Turning ideas into reality requires time, skills, and multiple resources. Dividing work into smaller tasks makes it possible to be developed by multiple people. 2do.net not only promotes public development but also applies it. All of our content is publicly available including plans, documents, discussions, collaboration, and supplies. Because of that people can get involved in every part of the project. Cooperation takes place in Social Media (e.g. Facebook and Reddit) and on GitHub, as 2do.net has not yet developed its own advanced communication system.

* **Projects administrated by Authors** - Each project has its own hierarchy and system of administration. Authors publishing on 2do.net retain all the rights to their content and should specify the license they are publishing it on. In other words: publish a description of what you are doing or want to do for others to get involved: you remain the administrator of your project, but others can help you when you don't have the necessary resources, skills, time, knowledge, etc.
* **Discussing goals, plans, ideas, and problems** - It depends on the Author on where the discussion takes place. We use Facebook, Reddit, and Github, but other projects are not obliged to take place there as well. The only option that every project has is messaging Authors through 2do.net (currently Authors know the sender's e-mail, but the sender doesn't know the mail of Author as they are sent from 2do.net mail: so check your spam inbox as Author).
* **Public Cooperation** - 2do.net basis on open collaboration - people can get involved in every part of this project. We apply the idea of open-source to not only software, but also administration, promotion, and other non-programming aspects of development. Open-source created the most popular encyclopedia (Wikipedia): 2do.net plans to become the most popular system for collaboration (and free of charge/commissions). In the future, this website is going to include a tool for projects management, an option to crowdsource needs (raising of feedback, work, resources, and supplies), and be a democratic project run my foundation.
* **Organizing necessary resources** - Initiatives need supplies - e.g. 2do.net needs servers. Until new software is developed it will be maintained on wordpress.com or University's servers for security reasons. Contact 2do.net by Social Media or help@2do.net 
* **Open pool prizes for solutions** - Contributors should be awarded with shares, prizes, votes, and attributions. 
  1. *Problem - when an issue is detected and described, a basket of prizes should be set: the Author could post a public promise of a specific number of shares to obtain, Users (e.g. external companies in need of the same solution) could also add to stakes (e.g. money, goods, services, etc.).Reporting should also be rewarded.*
  2. *Development - in some cases there should be a wage for development*
  4. *Solution - after development Solver should be rewarded. In a best-case scenario prize should be split across all the people involved using some sort of contribution measurement: reporter, solver, but also other people (e.g. those who provided feedback)* 
  5. *Credits - list of people involved with descriptions of their contributions should be published, so that other people could reward them later on*
  6. *Jury - people involved in choosing the best solution should also be rewarded* 
* **Distributed network of projects** - Maintaining 2do.net on universities’ servers will make this portal safe and free of charges/commissions.


## To do
2do.net’s goal is to create the most advanced system for cooperation. It is going to be done with democratic crowdsourcing and as transparent as possible. It will be run by a foundation to make it available to everybody for free.
* **Platform cooperative** - Improving 2do.net by preparing a system for cooperation: set of rules for democratic project administration where contributions are measured with shares waging votes/profits and software tools for development.
  * **free of charge and commissions** - maintaining the portal by volunteers and donations is going to make this portal available to anyone. This initiative shouldn't block people without money from using it. Creating a distributed network of servers (e.g. by Universities) and administrating it by volunteers rewarded from fundraising can make it happen
  * **constitution first** - terms of cooperation must be specified and defined: it will not only describe the processes of development (including solving disputes and spiting shares) but also secure projects from trolls wanting the project to fail (constitution should define the plan with its assumptions so that project can't be put onto the wrong path). There are going to be multiple templates for constitutions with simple summaries so that contributors could know the rules from a glance).
  * **spiting shares** - System for measuring work with shares that will decide the contributors' profits and strength of vote to develop projects democratically. Authors won't be forced to use this system for their published projects, but it will help people with limited resources to develop their ideas (e.g. students with business concepts, but without funding). The author is going to divide the project's development into parts from which shares are going to be spitted: e.g. 10% ideas, 20% supplies, 10% maintenance, 55% work, and 5% for Author - from then every contribution (e.g. comments with ideas) will get shares for involvement

* **Open-source project management software** - Creating open-source peer-to-peer project management software for private usage and organizations. Although there are many management software most of them have closed code not allowing people to personalize it. Creating a new one or building around an already advanced open-source solution is going to provide Users with not only a great communication channel, but also implement shares + wage votes, and tools for organization and editing all types of files (download a necessary plugin to view/edit the file you don't have a program for)
* **Foundation** - 2do.net is maintained by volunteers and donations, so it should be a registered Foundation. Establishing an organization would be beneficial due to tax exemptions, possible grants, government supervision, and the ability to share its legal identity to the projects that want to be “incubated”.
* **Intellectual Property protection** - Currently 2do.net is a website for volunteering, but in the future, it will be also a platform cooperative that is going to be a kind of business accelerator for developing projects by offering shares for certain contributions (work, investments, feedback, etc.). Progressing to the next stage requires defining a process for Intellectual Property.
  International patent registration for technical solutions costs thousands of dollars, but it does not provide any safety for ideas: e.g. while possible to secure usage of your device, you can't block people from creating a machine doing the same thing. That makes it hard for engineers to find a trustful investor, not to mention the troubles of visionaries without the necessary skills of designing a thing they want to see.
  IP protection's fundamental will be the community. Authors are going to be able to choose who can see their project: it will be possible to show your project/idea only to friends, graphic designers, or a narrow group of people (e.g. only Physics students from one University/Town, but also to show only a part of the project to everyone and select who can access details basing on applies to it.
  It is obligatory to define a process for disputes. 2do.net will not replace courts, but it must decide if a disputed content may still be published: basing on evidence attached to the IP theft report. This mechanism should be a mediation to try to reach an agreement between both sides of a dispute.
  How to manage Intellectual Property disputes? Maybe the decision should depend on what public and experts from topic concerning the dispute (e.g. programmers voting on software)?
  *Intellectual Property challenges are one of the reasons there are no websites such as 2do.net plans to be, but creating a place where people can cooperate on ideas is worth the effort.*
  
  
## Doing
* **Improving website**
* **Promotion** - We aim to promote 2do.net using content marketing (this means we focus on providing users with interesting information they want to engage). It is going to convince Academics, Media, NGOs, and other organizations to support 2do.net


## Done
* **Prototype** - www hosted on Wordpress.com using Directorist plugins and theme
* **Social Media cooperatives**
